##DESCRIPTION OF TASK:Heart Disease Prediction Using Decision Tree (Scikit-Learn)
PROJECT OVERVIEW:

This project focuses on building, training, and visualizing a Decision Tree classification model using Python and Scikit-Learn to predict the presence of heart disease based on patient medical attributes. Decision Trees are one of the most interpretable machine learning models, making them ideal for healthcare-related prediction tasks where transparency and explainability are important.

DATASET DESCRIPTION:

The project uses the Heart Disease Dataset (UCI / Kaggle version), which contains medical information of patients such as age, cholesterol level, blood pressure, heart rate, and other clinical attributes.

Target Variable: target

0 → No heart disease

1 → Presence of heart disease

The dataset is binary-classified and well balanced, which allows the decision tree model to create meaningful splits and multiple nodes.

TOOLS AND TECHNOLOGIES USED:
Programming Language

Python 3

Chosen for its simplicity, extensive data science ecosystem, and strong community support.

Libraries and Frameworks

Pandas

Used for loading the dataset, handling tabular data, and performing basic data manipulation.

NumPy

Used for numerical operations and efficient data handling.

Scikit-Learn (sklearn)

Used to implement the Decision Tree classifier, split data into training and testing sets, evaluate model performance, and visualize the decision tree.

Matplotlib

Used for plotting and visualizing the trained decision tree model.

DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENT:

Editor / IDE: Visual Studio Code (VS Code)

Platform: Jupyter Notebook (within VS Code)

METHODOLOGY AND WORKFLOW:
1. Dataset Loading
2. Feature and Target Selection
3. Train-Test Split
4. Model Training
5. Model Evaluation
6. Decision Tree Visualization
